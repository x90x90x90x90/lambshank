# Lambshank

Tool to download all Lamba functions and their code bases in an AWS region.

v2.0 new and improved! 

Ditched all reliance on external programs, tidied up the code (thanks fich!) and added pretty colours.


```
usage: lambshank.py [-h] --region REGION

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --region REGION  Specify a specific region
```
